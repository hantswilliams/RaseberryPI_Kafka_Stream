Raseberry_Static

Home address: 72.229.16.13


1) Set a STATIC ip for the raseberry pi via the router or from the device itself; 
doing it form the router is the preferred form / e.g., for my Pi, have assigned address a 
static IP host address of 192.168.1.14 

2) Set up port-forwarding via the router, to enable devices from external (outside network acceess)
to get data from the device / e.g., now within the device, set up specific ports that can be 
accessed via the general IP address (72.229.16.13)

For RaspberryPi_1
> 7001 = 22  (for SSH)
> 7002 = 9092  (for KAFKA stream)
> 8000 = 8000   (for NGINX) - note, most routers utilize :80 for their own GUI for the router UI, 
so pick a rand port range like 8000 or 9000 to route HTTP-like requests using NGINX 

3) The firewall settings for right now with home router is set to LOW; e.g., 
LAN->WAN = ALLOW ALL, and WAN->LAN ALLOW ALL // so HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, etc...are all turned on 
might want to change this later
